# Weather App
The weather app project is a dynamic and user-friendly web application built using React.js.

It utilizes OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather forecasts for various cities around the world. 

The app allows users to search for a city by name and view its weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description of the current weather.

Additionally, the app displays an appropriate image based on the weather conditions in the selected city.
